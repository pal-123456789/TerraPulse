### Option 2: Native Mobile App (Capacitor)

For full native features (camera, sensors, etc.) and app store distribution.

#### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Git** for version control
- **For iOS**: Mac with Xcode 15+ installed
- **For Android**: Android Studio with SDK 33+

#### Setup Instructions:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd terra-pulse-watch

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Add native platforms
npx cap add ios      # For iOS development
npx cap add android  # For Android development

# 4. Build the web app
npm run build

# 5. Sync web code to native projects
npx cap sync

# 6. Open in native IDE
npx cap open ios     # Opens Xcode
npx cap open android # Opens Android Studio
```

#### Running on Device/Emulator:

```bash
# Run on connected Android device or emulator
npx cap run android

# Run on iOS simulator or connected device
npx cap run ios
```

#### Hot Reload During Development:

The app is pre-configured for live reload. When running through Capacitor, it connects to the Lovable preview server, so changes you make in Lovable appear instantly on your device.

To switch to local development:

1. Edit `capacitor.config.ts`
2. Comment out or remove the `server.url` line
3. Run `npx cap sync` to use local builds instead

#### Building for Release:

**Android APK:**
```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync android
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
# APK will be in android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/
```

**iOS App Store:**
1. Open Xcode: `npx cap open ios`
2. Select your team in Signing & Capabilities
3. Product → Archive
4. Distribute via App Store Connect
